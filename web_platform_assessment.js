// Web Platform Assessment for Flutter Audio Toolkit

/**
 * AUDIO PROCESSING ON WEB PLATFORM
 * 
 * Current FlutterAudioToolkit features and their web compatibility:
 * 
 * 1. AUDIO CONVERSION (MP3/WAV/OGG → AAC/M4A)
 *    - Web Support: LIMITED
 *    - Native implementations use MediaCodec (Android) and AVAudioConverter (iOS)
 *    - Web would need WebCodecs API or AudioContext + OfflineAudioContext
 *    - Challenges: 
 *      * Browser support varies for different codecs
 *      * M4A encoding not widely supported in browsers
 *      * Performance significantly slower than native
 * 
 * 2. WAVEFORM EXTRACTION
 *    - Web Support: GOOD
 *    - Can use Web Audio API AudioContext.decodeAudioData()
 *    - AudioBuffer provides raw PCM data for waveform generation
 *    - Works well for visualization purposes
 * 
 * 3. AUDIO TRIMMING
 *    - Web Support: MODERATE
 *    - Can extract segments using AudioBuffer slicing
 *    - Re-encoding to compressed formats is challenging
 *    - WAV output would be most feasible
 * 
 * 4. NOISE DETECTION & ANALYSIS
 *    - Web Support: GOOD
 *    - Web Audio API provides AnalyserNode for frequency analysis
 *    - Can implement noise detection algorithms in JavaScript
 *    - Performance adequate for real-time analysis
 * 
 * 5. FILE SYSTEM OPERATIONS
 *    - Web Support: LIMITED
 *    - Browser security restricts file system access
 *    - Must use File API / downloads folder only
 *    - No direct file path access like native platforms
 * 
 * OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
 * - Waveform visualization: ✅ Fully feasible
 * - Audio playback: ✅ Already works (HTML5 audio)
 * - Basic analysis: ✅ Feasible with Web Audio API
 * - Audio conversion: ⚠️ Limited format support, poor performance
 * - File management: ⚠️ Restricted by browser security
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION:
 * Web support could be added with significant limitations:
 * - Focus on waveform generation and playback features
 * - Conversion limited to basic formats (MP3, WAV)
 * - File operations restricted to downloads/uploads
 * - Performance warnings for users
